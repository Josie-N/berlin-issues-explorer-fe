`Find the perfect issue for you`
`Want to contribute to open source? Issues Explorer helps you find the right issue and project.`

```
Contributing to open source helps you improve your coding skills and polish your CV.
You can also connect with great people.
And you make the life of the users of this open source project a bit easier.
You do not need to know much to get started:
Many projects also need help with beginner friendly tasks like improving the documentation.

## Instructions / How does this work?

## Who is this for?

## Issues Explorer Tool

### Filters

- by github labels (e.g. "Good first issue"), we can preselect the labels we want to filter by so I would guess around 10 max?
  - Good First Issue
  - Documentation
- by language (e.g. javascript), might contain many (>30) languages later
- maybe consider setting some filter by default (e.g. Good First issue)

### Search

- simple text search that will check title, repo title and description

### Results List
- display issues

### Other / Aside

- Feedback System (feedback form)
- Help
- Instructions on how to use filters?
